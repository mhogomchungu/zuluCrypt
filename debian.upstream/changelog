     -- add support for creating a "plain dm-crypt" volume at a "none zero offset".This type of volume is useful as a
        "poor man's version of a hidden volume feature in TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt".Best thing about this type of hidden
        volume is that the outer volume can be anything including an "exposed file system".Currently,only zuluMount-gui can
        open this type of volume by clicking "options" followed by "Set Volume Offset" on the mounting dialog prompt.
