.SH DESCRIPTION
zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It aims to simplify using cryptsetup volumes by creating a simple to use
command line interface and a Qt based GUI front end to the command line.

The command line program is called "zuluCrypt-cli", the Qt based GUI is called "zuluCrypt-gui".
The cli part of the program is an suid program to allow management of the volumes without 
setting up sudo with appropriate permissions first or requiring root's password.

The GUI part of the program calls the cli part for its operations.

This tool will create volumes only in non system partitions.

System partition is a partition with an active entry in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab

.SH USAGE
usage: zuluCrypt-cli < operation > < options specific to the operation >
.br
operation list:
.br
-c         create an encrypted volume
.br
-o         open and encrypted volume
.br
-O         open an encrypted volume but do not mount it( -m therefore not needed )
.br
-q         close an opened encrypted volume
.br
-r         remove a key from luks volume
.br
-a         add a key to luks volume
.br
-i         check if a device contain a luks volume
.br
-s         check if a device is opened and print its properties if it is
.br
-b         show status of each slot of luks volume."0"=empty,"1"=occupied,"2"=invalid slot,"3"=last occupied
.br
-A         print the list of all partitions on the system
.br
-N         print a list of non system partitions on the system( partitions with no active entries in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab
.br
-T         print a detailed list of mounted partitions.Must be used with -A or -S or -N
.br
-Z         print a detailed list of unmounted partitions.Must be used with -A or -S or -N
.br
-S         print a list of system partitions on the system( partitions with active entries in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab
.br
-w         check if UUID matches UUID of any partition
.br
-P         get device path from mapper( located at /dev/mapper )
.br
-L         print a list of all opened volumes and their mount point.The list is not formatted
.br
-X         open a device pointed by argument -d and write random data to it hiding data previously written to device
.br
-W         check if a device is a truecrypt device or not,required argument are -p or -f
.br
-U         print UUID of a given device,required argument: -d
.br
-H         compare a header on a luks device to a backup header,required arg: -d and -f
.br
-M         create a publicly accessible "mirror" of the mount point in "/run/media/public/" from the original created in "/run/media/private/$USER/"
.br
-J         create a plain mapper owned by the user who run the command on a device pointed by argument -d
.br
-B         create a luks header backup
.br
-R         restore a luks header on a device from backup
.br
-E         encrypt a single file
.br
-D         decrypt a single file
.br
.br
.B NOTE

.br
.br

options that goes with above operations:
.br
-G         module name to use to get a passphrase to open a volume
.br
-e         mode for opening volumes(ro*/rw) when used with -o/-O. path to destination file when used with -E/-D
.br
-k         do not ask for confirmation when doing dangerous operations
.br
-d         path to a file or partition with encrypted volume
.br
-m         path component to be added to mount point prefix(/run/media/private/$USER or /home/$USER)

.br
-t         type of volume (plain/luks*)
.br
-g         random number generator (/dev/random or /dev/urandom*)
.br

-p         passphrase 
.br
-f         path to keyfile or luks header backup
.br
-y         passphrase already in the volume(required by -a if -u is absent and -h is also absent)
.br
